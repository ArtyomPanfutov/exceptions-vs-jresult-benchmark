# Exceptions vs JResult                               j
The following repository contains a benchmark comparing the performance of two approaches for error handling:
* Exceptions
* Operation Result Pattern implemented in JResult library.

## Results
Benchmark             Mode  Cnt     Score    Error  Units
Benchmark.exceptions  avgt   25  1194.478 ± 16.746  ns/op
Benchmark.jresult     avgt   25     0.559 ±  0.048  ns/op


The "Score" represents the average execution time per operation (in nanoseconds per operation, ns/op) for the benchmarked methods.
For Benchmark.exceptions, the average score is 1194.478 ns/op, indicating that operations using exceptions took, on average, around 1194 nanoseconds to complete.
For Benchmark.jresult, the average score is significantly lower, at 0.559 ns/op, suggesting that operations using the JResult pattern took, on average, just over half a nanosecond to complete.

## Interpretation
The JResult pattern demonstrates a significantly lower average execution time compared to the traditional exception handling approach. This suggests that for the benchmarked scenarios, using the JResult pattern is much more efficient in terms of performance.
The smaller error range and score for JResult indicate more consistent and predictable performance.
The large difference in performance could be attributed to the overhead associated with creating, throwing, and catching exceptions in Java, which is not present when using a pattern like JResult that relies on return values to indicate success or failure.

## Considerations
While the JResult pattern shows superior performance in this benchmark, it's essential to consider the context in which it is used. Exception handling might still be preferable in situations where error conditions are truly exceptional and not part of the normal control flow.
Benchmarks are synthetic and might not always represent real-world usage accurately. It's crucial to consider the specific use cases and requirements of your application when choosing between these approaches.
Overall, the benchmark results favor the JResult pattern for scenarios where operations frequently result in success or recoverable failures, and the overhead of exceptions can be avoided.
